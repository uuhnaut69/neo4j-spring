A graph database is a database designed to treat the relationships between data as equally important to the data itself. It is intended to hold data without constricting it to a pre-defined model. 

- A graph is composed of two elements: a node and a relationship.
- A graph database is an online database management system with Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations working on a graph data model.
- Unlike other databases, relationships take first priority in graph databases. This means your application doesnâ€™t have to infer data connections using things like foreign keys or out-of-band processing, such as MapReduce.

- The data model for a graph database is also significantly simpler and more expressive than those of relational or other NoSQL databases.

- Graph databases are built for use with transactional (OLTP) systems and are engineered with transactional integrity and operational availability in mind.
